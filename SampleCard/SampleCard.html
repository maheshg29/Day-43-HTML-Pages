      <h3>Kanha National Park</h3>
      <p>Kanha National Park is a paradise for wildlife lovers. With a core zone of 363 square miles, 
        it’s the largest national park in Central India. It’s also considered one of the most well-managed. 
        The result is a beautiful park that’s teeming with wildlife. With approximately 105 Bengal tigers, 
        it’s a great place to spot the big cats in the wild. But there’s so much else to see there, 
        including leopards, sloth bears, sambar and barasingha deer. 
        Kanha’s breeding program played a very important role in saving the barasingha from extinction.</p>

      <h3>Bandhavgarh National Park</h3>
      <p>Bandhavgarh is very picturesque, and popular with photographers and wildlife enthusiasts.
         It’s always on the lists of the top national parks in India. The ruins of an ancient fort 
         makes for a great backdrop to this park, with a core area of 40 square miles and a buffer
          area of approximately 154 square miles. It’s one of the best places to spot a tiger in India.
           Located among the Vindya Hills in Madhya Pradesh, Bandhavgarh boasts one of the highest 
           densities of Bengal tigers in the world. But the magnificent cat is not the only attraction
            here. There are also 36 other mammals, including leopards, chital, dhole and nilgai
             (“blue bulls”), more than 150 species of birds, and around 80 species of butterflies. </p>

      <h3>Kaziranga National Park</h3>
      <p>Located in the northeast state of Assam, Kaziranga is one of the finest wildlife refuges in the world.
         Home to the world’s largest population of one-horned rhinos, the park is an undisturbed natural area 
         of wet grasslands, swamps, and pools in the Brahmaputra Valley floodplain. On the UNESCO Natural Heritage
          list for India, Kaziranga is a great conservation success story, having saved the one-horned rhino from
           the brink of extinction. In 1903, there were only 12 left in the region; now there are about 1,800. </p>

      <h3>Sunderbans National Park</h3>
      <p>There is no place else on earth like the Sunderbans. Formed by the Ganges River and Brahmaputra River deltas in 
        the Bay of Bengal, the Sunderbans is the world’s largest mangrove forest and one of the most biologically productive
         of all ecosystems. Encompassing 513 square miles, Sunderbans National Park is situated within a larger UNESCO Biosphere
          Reserve and the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve. Many rare and endangered wildlife species call this region home, including 
          the estuarine crocodile, Gangetic dolphin, Olive Ridley turtle, king cobra and Bengal tiger. Approximately 100 Bengal
           tigers live in the watery world of the Sunderbans, having adapted to an almost amphibious life. They can swim long 
           distances and feed on fish, crab, and water Monitor Lizards. It’s a unique landscape that attracts wildlife lovers
            who are mesmerized by the mangroves, waterways, birds, and rich biodiversity.</p>

      <h3>Ranthambhore National Park</h3>
      <p>With the picturesque remains of a crumbling fort, a living temple, and three mirror-like lakes, Ranthambhore is 
        one of the most photographed national parks in India. The former hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Jaipur, 
        Ranthambhore National Park is part of a much larger 502 square mile tiger reserve. It’s home to approximately 45 
        Bengal tigers, and is within easy travel distance of Delhi. This makes it a very popular place indeed. Still, it’s a 
        good place to spot tigers as well as leopards, caracal, sloth bears, spotted and sambar deer, nilgai and Indian 
        gazelle, golden jackal, striped hyena, pangolin, honey badger and more.</p>
